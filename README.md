### Bakery Sales Forecasting: 
In the "Forecasting-Sales-ARIMA" project, we employ ARIMA to predict bakery sales. We analyze historical sales data and develop forecasting models to aid in production and inventory planning.

### Apple Stock Price Forecasting: 
In the "Forecasting-Stocks-ARIMA" project, we apply ARIMA to forecast the price of Apple stocks. Utilizing past price data, we create forecasting models to assist investors and traders in making more informed decisions.

Both projects demonstrate the practical application of ARIMA in different forecasting contexts, offering valuable insights for time series analysis.
